(2) Here’s a detailed list of test cases for validating a product to be ISO 20022 compliant, organized by key testing areas. These test cases apply to payment messages (e.g., pain.001, pacs.008, pacs.002) and can be adapted for other ISO 20022 domains like securities, trade finance, and cards.

1. Message Structure & Syntax Validation

Objective: Ensure that messages conform to the ISO 20022 XML schema and rules.

1.1 Schema Validation

✅ TC-001: Validate an ISO 20022-compliant message against the official XSD schema.
❌ TC-002: Send a message with missing mandatory fields and verify rejection.
❌ TC-003: Send a message with additional, undefined fields and verify rejection.
❌ TC-004: Test a message with an incorrect namespace or version and check error handling.

1.2 Field-Level Validation

✅ TC-005: Validate a correctly formatted IBAN/BIC in an account field.
❌ TC-006: Enter an invalid IBAN (e.g., incorrect checksum) and verify rejection.
❌ TC-007: Provide an unsupported currency code and confirm rejection.
❌ TC-008: Test a message with an incorrectly formatted date (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY instead of YYYY-MM-DD).

2. Business Rule Validation

Objective: Ensure that messages follow ISO 20022 business rules and logic.

2.1 Mandatory & Conditional Fields

✅ TC-009: Ensure all mandatory fields are populated (e.g., CreditorAccount, DebtorAccount).
❌ TC-010: Omit a required field (e.g., Amount) and verify system rejection.
❌ TC-011: Omit a conditional field that becomes mandatory (e.g., UltimateDebtor for intermediary payments).

2.2 Data Consistency Rules

✅ TC-012: Ensure that the sum of transaction amounts equals the total batch amount (for bulk payments).
❌ TC-013: Enter a different currency code in Amount vs. Currency field and verify error.
❌ TC-014: Provide a mismatched country code and BIC (e.g., DE for a FR BIC).

3. Message Processing & Workflow

Objective: Ensure that messages are processed in the correct order and workflow.

3.1 Message Sequencing

✅ TC-015: Verify a pain.001 (payment initiation) message is successfully processed before sending pacs.008 (FI to FI credit transfer).
❌ TC-016: Attempt to process a pacs.008 before a corresponding pain.001 and check system response.

3.2 Duplicate Message Handling

✅ TC-017: Ensure duplicate messages (with the same Message ID) are identified and handled correctly.
❌ TC-018: Send a duplicate transaction within a short time frame and verify rejection.

3.3 Payment Status & Rejections

✅ TC-019: Send a pacs.008 (FI to FI credit transfer) and verify the correct response in a pacs.002 (payment status report).
❌ TC-020: Process an invalid transaction and confirm an appropriate rejection message (pacs.002 with RJCT status).

4. Security & Compliance Testing

Objective: Ensure that messages follow security protocols and regulatory requirements.

4.1 Authentication & Authorization

✅ TC-021: Validate digital signature authentication for ISO 20022 messages.
❌ TC-022: Attempt to process a payment message without authentication and verify rejection.

4.2 Data Privacy & Encryption

✅ TC-023: Ensure sensitive fields (e.g., Creditor Name, Debtor Name) are encrypted in transit.
❌ TC-024: Send a payment with unencrypted personally identifiable information (PII) and check compliance failure.

4.3 Fraud & AML Compliance

✅ TC-025: Process a transaction within normal limits and verify acceptance.
❌ TC-026: Send a transaction exceeding a predefined fraud threshold and check if flagged.
❌ TC-027: Test a transaction involving a blacklisted entity and verify system rejection.

5. Interoperability & Compatibility

Objective: Ensure compatibility with different banks, networks, and systems.

5.1 Multi-Format Compatibility

✅ TC-028: Validate message transformation between ISO 20022 and MT103 (SWIFT FIN).
❌ TC-029: Convert an incorrectly structured ISO 20022 message to MT103 and verify failure.

5.2 Backward Compatibility

✅ TC-030: Process a pacs.008 message from an earlier ISO 20022 version (e.g., 2019).
❌ TC-031: Attempt to process an obsolete message version and verify system rejection.

6. Performance & Load Testing

Objective: Validate system response under high transaction loads.

6.1 Load Handling

✅ TC-032: Process 100,000 transactions in a batch file and verify system stability.
❌ TC-033: Attempt 500,000 transactions in a single batch and check for slowdowns.

6.2 Latency Testing

✅ TC-034: Ensure a payment message is processed within X milliseconds (as per SLA).
❌ TC-035: Test system response when processing delays occur (e.g., retry mechanism).

7. Negative & Edge Case Testing

Objective: Validate robustness by handling unexpected inputs and scenarios.

7.1 Malformed XML Handling

❌ TC-036: Test a message with broken XML syntax and verify system rejection.
❌ TC-037: Send an XML message with an extra, undefined tag and confirm rejection.

7.2 Invalid Data Entries

❌ TC-038: Enter a string in a numeric amount field and verify rejection.
❌ TC-039: Use an invalid character set (e.g., non-UTF-8) in a text field.

7.3 Unauthorized Transactions

❌ TC-040: Attempt to process a transaction with an unauthorized user and check for rejection.
❌ TC-041: Simulate a session timeout while sending a message and verify retry behavior.

Final Thoughts

These test cases cover the most critical aspects of ISO 20022 compliance, ensuring technical accuracy, business logic validation, security, and interoperability.
