(5) Here’s an expanded set of ISO 20022 test cases to validate compliance with AML (Anti-Money Laundering), PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive), and Basel III (Capital & Liquidity Requirements).

1. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance

Objective: Ensure ISO 20022 messages comply with global AML regulations (FATF, EU AMLD, FinCEN).

1.1 Sanctions Screening

✅ AML-001: Process a valid pacs.008 (FI-to-FI transfer) where the beneficiary is not on any sanctions list.
❌ AML-002: Send a pacs.008 with a beneficiary flagged on an OFAC/EU Sanctions List and verify rejection.

1.2 High-Risk Jurisdiction Transactions

✅ AML-003: Process a payment from a low-risk jurisdiction successfully.
❌ AML-004: Attempt a transaction from a high-risk country (e.g., FATF blacklist) and verify automatic flagging.

1.3 Structuring & Smurfing Detection

❌ AML-005: Attempt to split a $1,000,000 payment into ten smaller $99,999 transactions and ensure detection.

1.4 Unusual Payment Patterns

❌ AML-006: Detect an unusually high-value transfer from an account with no prior large transactions.
❌ AML-007: Attempt a transaction from an account showing multiple daily international transfers exceeding risk thresholds.

1.5 PEP & UBO Screening

✅ AML-008: Process a valid camt.052 (account statement) for a customer not identified as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP).
❌ AML-009: Identify and reject a transaction where the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) is a PEP flagged for risk.

2. PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive - EU)

Objective: Ensure ISO 20022 messages comply with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), Open Banking, and Payment Security requirements.

2.1 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)

✅ PSD2-001: Process a pain.001 (credit transfer) with two-factor authentication (2FA) successfully.
❌ PSD2-002: Attempt a pain.001 without proper authentication and verify system rejection.

2.2 Open Banking (Third-Party Access)

✅ PSD2-003: Validate a pain.013 (Request for Payment) from a Third-Party Provider (TPP) with proper authorization.
❌ PSD2-004: Attempt a pain.013 from an unauthorized TPP and ensure rejection.

2.3 Transaction Risk Analysis (TRA) Exemptions

✅ PSD2-005: Process a low-value SEPA payment (€30) with SCA exemption.
❌ PSD2-006: Attempt a high-value cross-border transfer (€20,000) without SCA and verify rejection.

2.4 Fraud Detection & Monitoring

✅ PSD2-007: Process a pacs.008 where the payer and payee have a transaction history.
❌ PSD2-008: Detect a transaction where the payer has never transacted with the recipient before and flag for review.

2.5 Instant Payments & Consent Validation

✅ PSD2-009: Ensure an instant pain.001 payment is processed only if explicit consent is provided.
❌ PSD2-010: Attempt an unauthorized instant payment request and verify rejection.

3. Basel III Compliance (Capital & Liquidity Risk)

Objective: Ensure ISO 20022 messages support regulatory reporting, liquidity risk management, and stress testing.

3.1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) Reporting

✅ B3-001: Validate a camt.052 (intraday balance report) showing LCR compliance.
❌ B3-002: Detect an LCR below the 100% minimum requirement and trigger a regulatory alert.

3.2 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) Monitoring

✅ B3-003: Process a camt.053 (end-of-day statement) showing stable funding sources.
❌ B3-004: Identify an NSFR shortfall (below 100%) and ensure system flagging.

3.3 Large Exposure Limits

✅ B3-005: Process a pacs.009 (high-value payment) where exposure remains below regulatory thresholds.
❌ B3-006: Attempt a payment causing exposure to exceed the 25% of capital limit and verify rejection.

3.4 Stress Testing & Liquidity Shock Scenarios

❌ B3-007: Simulate a bank run scenario and ensure proper camt.052 liquidity reporting.
❌ B3-008: Test a market stress event with multiple liquidity shocks and validate capital adequacy reporting.
