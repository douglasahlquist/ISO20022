(3) Here’s an extended set of ISO 20022 compliance test cases, now covering cross-border payments, domestic clearing, and securities processing in addition to general message validation.

1. Cross-Border Payments (pacs.008, pacs.009, camt.056, camt.029, pain.002)

Objective: Ensure compliance with international payment processing rules, SWIFT CBPR+ (ISO 20022 for cross-border payments), and regulatory requirements.

1.1 Message Validation

❌ CBP-002: Send a pacs.008 with an invalid BIC (SWIFT code) and verify rejection.
❌ CBP-003: Enter an incorrect currency code (e.g., USD for an EU-based transaction) and check system response.

1.2 Transaction Screening & AML Compliance

✅ CBP-004: Process a low-value cross-border payment below AML thresholds successfully.
❌ CBP-005: Attempt a high-value transaction that requires additional AML verification and ensure it is flagged.
❌ CBP-006: Process a transaction to a sanctioned entity and verify rejection with camt.056 (payment cancellation request).
❌ CBP-007: Send a transaction with an incomplete originator/beneficiary address and confirm rejection.

1.3 FX & Multi-Currency Handling

✅ CBP-008: Process a payment where the source currency is EUR, and the beneficiary receives USD, ensuring FX conversion is accurate.
❌ CBP-009: Send a transaction with an unsupported currency pair and verify failure.

1.4 Intermediary Bank Handling

✅ CBP-010: Verify a pacs.009 (cover payment) is processed correctly when an intermediary bank is involved.
❌ CBP-011: Simulate missing intermediary bank details and ensure rejection or return with camt.029.

1.5 Payment Status & Returns

✅ CBP-012: Validate a correct pacs.002 (payment status) response for a successful transaction.
❌ CBP-013: Trigger a pacs.002 with RJCT status due to incorrect account details.
✅ CBP-014: Process a camt.056 (payment cancellation request) and ensure the original payment is blocked before settlement.
❌ CBP-015: Attempt to cancel a settled payment using camt.056 and verify failure with camt.029 (unable to apply).

2. Domestic Clearing & Real-Time Payments (pacs.008, pacs.004, camt.054, pain.001, pain.002)

Objective: Ensure compatibility with local clearing systems (ACH, SEPA, FedNow, RTP) and compliance with ISO 20022-based domestic payment formats.

2.1 Payment Initiation & Batch Processing

✅ DCP-001: Process a valid pain.001 (payment initiation) message for a single SEPA Credit Transfer.
✅ DCP-002: Submit a bulk pain.001 with 1,000 transactions and ensure all are processed successfully.
❌ DCP-003: Send a pain.001 with incorrect local clearing codes and verify rejection.

2.2 SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst)

✅ DCP-004: Process a valid pacs.008 for an instant payment within 10 seconds.
❌ DCP-005: Attempt an SCT Inst transfer with a bank that does not support real-time payments and ensure rejection.

2.3 Direct Debit Handling

✅ DCP-006: Process a valid pain.008 (SEPA Direct Debit) and confirm transaction execution.
❌ DCP-007: Attempt to debit an account without a mandate reference and verify rejection.

2.4 Payment Returns & Reversals

✅ DCP-008: Simulate a pacs.004 (payment return) and verify funds are credited back to the sender.
❌ DCP-009: Process a return without a valid reason code and confirm system rejection.

2.5 Reconciliation & Reporting

✅ DCP-010: Validate that camt.054 (debit/credit notification) reflects the correct transaction details.
❌ DCP-011: Test a camt.054 with incorrect transaction references and verify reconciliation failure.

3. Securities Processing (sese.023, sese.025, semt.002, camt.060)

Objective: Ensure compliance with ISO 20022 securities messaging for trade settlements, asset servicing, and reconciliation.

❌ EDGE-002: Attempt to submit an outdated message version and ensure rejection.
✅ EDGE-003: Simulate a system outage during message processing and verify system recovery.
❌ EDGE-004: Test message processing with large batch files (1M transactions) and measure performance.
